# Games To Play

This mini web app was my first solo assignment at the start of the JavaScript section of my Software Development course at CodeClan. The task was to create a front-end JavaScript application that allows users to input values for different properties relating to the theme of the app and see them displayed in a list underneath. The minimum viable product included creating a form in HTML with inputs for relevant data, accessing the data from the form in the form's submit event object, creating a list in HTML, appending the submitted data to the list, and adding a "Delete All" button which clears all of the list items from the list. The recommended extensions were: refactoring the code to extract helper functions with single responsibilites to keep each function small and readable, adding a new form input and a new input type e.g. a radio button, and styling the application with CSS. I also added a button to each list entry that allows the user to remove that particular list item. The objective of the assignment was to demonstrate comprehension of the Document Object Model by the ability to attach event listeners to DOM elements to respond to events, to access data from the event object, and to use the document object to add information to the page by manipulating the DOM.
